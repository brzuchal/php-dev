# PHP project coordination

This is an experiment that attempts to make it much easier for people to find 
things to work on for PHP internals, related infrastructure, extensions and 
most other non-userland things.

Due to it being an experiment, it's currently outside of the PHP project's 
infrastructure. 

If you have an item you would like added please provide:

* a title
* a short description
* a link to where the work is described in greater detail, and people can 
ask questions.

The link to where the work can be discussed could be bugs.php.net, a 
github/gitlab repo, a slack channel. 
Whatever you think is appropriate for the piece of work being discussed. 

The main thing is that people should be able to see what needs to be done, 
and discuss it.

## Things to work on

* RFC's: [Union Types v2](https://github.com/php/php-rfcs/pull/1) _(Proposal for the 
  addition of union types `T1|T2|...`. 
  There has been a previous proposal on this topic, which has been declined.)_
* [Internal stuff to work on]({{< ref "page/internal-stuff-to-work-on.md" >}})
* [Infrastructure stuff to work on]({{< ref "page/infrastructure-stuff-to-work-on.md" >}})
* [Bugs to work on]({{< ref "page/bugs-to-work-on.md" >}})
