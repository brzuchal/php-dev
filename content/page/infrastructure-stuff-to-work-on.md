## Move documentation from SVN to Git/github

Editing the documentation is currently quite difficult. 
Moving it to git/github would make it easier.

## Setup easier to use wiki

The number of people who are able to edit our wiki are very small due to 
how hard it is to collorate on documents, as well as how difficult it is 
for people who don't have a php.net account to make changes. 
We need to keep the RFCs and voting on the wiki, due to needing the karma 
system to check who can vote. 
However pretty much everything else could be migrated to make it easier 
to collaborate.

## Smoother PECL signup process

Currently the pecl signup process is heavily 'gate-keepered'. 
People sometimes wait weeks for their account to be approved. 
We could change the workflow, so that people have to submit a compilable 
repo, and then after that their account is either automatically approved, 
or the number of people who can approve those validated signup requests 
should be increased.
