This page gives an overview of the current *RFC*'s for *PHP*.

To create a new RFC, see [How To Create](link.html) an *RFC*.

> **Note!** An RFC is effectively "owned" by the person that created it. 
> If you want to make changes, get permission from the creator. 
> If no agreement can be found, the only course of action is to create 
> a competing RFC. In this case, the old RFC page should be modified 
> to become an intermediate page that points to all the competing RFC's.

A new page in this RFC namespace will automatically be loaded with 
an RFC template. Customize as needed.
